#How to reverse a number? (Without using string, array)
123 to 321?
Ans:

Step-1: multiply by 10
Step-2: add the next number in queue

Ex:

1. Way - 1: (This method has a problem that it wont count 0 even for once if it is in the beginning)(input 0, expected output 0 but resultant output will be blank since we will use a while loop which will have the condition like "x>0". But wont count 0 if it's at the end like 300 output will be 3).

123

int main(){

int n = 123;

int sum=0;

int x = n%10;

sum = sum*10 + n;
n = n/10;

}


2. Way - 2: (This method has a problem that it will count 0 every time even at the end. Like input 300 ,output will be 003 which aint correct).

123

int main(){

int n = 123;

int x = n%10;

print("%d",x);

}


3. Way-3: Do-While method

do{

int n = 123;

int sum=0;

int x = n%10;

sum = sum*10 + n;
n = n/10;

printf("%d",sum);
}

while(x>0);

Doing it this way will count 0 if it's the only input. Input 0 , output 0.
